//Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Javascript object 
//(see example below) and use it to translate a holiday card 
//message from English into another language. Each member of 
//the team will build a JavaScript module that will convert 
//text entered into an input field to the language that they 
//choose.

// {"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":"gott",
//"new":"nytt", "year":"Ã¥r"}
// This is Swedish, so please choose other languages. You can 
//add as many words/translations as you wish so that the user 
//can write more complex holiday cards.

// One team member creates a Github project and adds the others 
//as collaborators.
// Each team member picks a language.
// Your project should have one HTML file that has a textarea, 
//a select element with an option for each language, a button 
//with a label of "Translate", and an empty DOM element into 
//which the translated text will be inserted.
// The team must discuss and choose a single variable name that 
//will hold all of the logic that the team creates (i.e. see the 
//Sedan example above).
// Each team member will create one JavaScript file that contains 
//one IIFE. Each teammate's IIFE will augment the other 
//teammates' IIFEs.
// The lexicon should be a private variable that cannot be accessed 
//by the other team member's module except through an accessor
//(getter) method.
// Each IIFE should expose, in its public interface, a method 
//named translateTo{Language} (e.g. translateToSpanish or 
//translateToFinnish) that accepts a single argument. That 
//argument's value should be the text entered in by the user.
// The team should create an extra JavaScript file that handles 
//interacting with the form elements and determining which method 
//should be called.
